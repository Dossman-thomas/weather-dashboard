When a city name is submitted in the input field, a dashboard featuring the current weather, plus a five-day forecast will render on the page for the submitted city.  

The application will save each user input as a button that re-renders the corresponding city's weather and forecast in the dashboard using local storage. 

Finally, users can click the clear button to empty local storage and start new.
